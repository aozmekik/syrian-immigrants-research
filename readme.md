## Analysis Overview

The analysis process involves defining labels for survey questions 47 to 56, which cover various life aspects. Each question is associated with a set of responses categorized into five labels ranging from "Much Better" to "Much Worse". The analysis calculates the count and percentage of responses for each category, providing a quantitative measure of the changes experienced by the respondents.

## Key Findings

The survey analysis reveals significant insights across different aspects:

- **Social Pressure and Relationships**: There's a general trend towards improvement in social pressure levels and relationships with locals.
- **Access to Services**: Improved access to public services, healthcare, and educational opportunities is noted, though challenges persist for some.
- **Employment and Housing Conditions**: Positive changes in employment conditions and housing are reported, indicating an improvement in living standards.
- **Discrimination and Future Expectations**: Experiences of discrimination have decreased for many, and future expectations vary, with a notable portion of respondents feeling more optimistic.

## Detailed Analysis

The detailed analysis includes statistical breakdowns for each question, highlighting the distribution of responses and identifying trends over time. For instance, the analysis of healthcare access shows a majority reporting improvements, while the outlook on future expectations presents a mixed view, with optimism counterbalanced by persistent concerns.

## Conclusion

This research provides a comprehensive overview of the changes experienced by the surveyed group in various life aspects. The findings underscore the importance of continued monitoring and support to address ongoing challenges and leverage areas of improvement. The detailed analysis in `survey.ipynb` serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders looking to understand and respond to the needs of the community.

## Future Work

Further research could expand on these findings by incorporating additional data points and conducting longitudinal studies to track changes over an extended period. This would offer deeper insights into the long-term impact of interventions and evolving community needs.
